    <string name="artist_donation_text">Nudge used to have a very ugly icon. Without Joey\'s help,
    this app wouldn\'t look half as good as it does now. Whether the icon itself or the color style,
    Joey\'s insight helped give Nudge some personality. So even if you find the functionality
    itself mediocre, please consider making a contribution to Joey so he can make more awesome icons
    in the future!</string>
