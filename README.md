# Nudge
Nudge is an automated text messaging service. It was initially created to remind people (including myself) to perform
certain tasks by sending text nudges to a recipient. It could also be used for other purposes, such as
accountability nudges or PSAs.

I've decide to make Nudge open source. I think anyone should have the ability to make Nudge look as nice as possible should they so choose. I've also created an adfree branch that you can use to build an adfree version of the product (although I would encourage you to support your developers!). I didn't do extensive testing on it, so if there are any issues, please send me a message or create an issue stating which version of the product you are using.
